# SIFT
# - Applied a Difference of Gaussians (DoG) to detect Key Points.
# - Descriptors are a 128-Dimensional Vector
# - Features are Scale and Rotation Invariant

# System
- Feature Matching and Description (SIFT)
- Feature Matching (FLANN KNN)
- Homographic Verification (RANSAC)
- Bounding Boxes
- IoU Performance

# Keypoints:
# - Distinctive locations in the image (corners, edges, blobs) detected using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). 
# - They remain stable across scale, rotation, and minor affine transformations.
Keypoints are specific regions of interest in the image (corners, edges, blobs).

# Descriptors:
# - 128-dimensional vectors that encode local gradient information around the keypoints.
Descriptors are vector representations of keypoints (gradient histograms).

# FLANN
# - Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN) used to match feature descriptos between templae and target.
# - KD-Tree index structure for high-dimensional nearest neigbhor search.

# Lowe's Ratio Test
# - Filter ambiguous matches, where an acceptable match has a nearest neighbour significantly close, <THRESHOLD>X second best match.
# - Ensures only distinctive, high-quality matches remain.

# RANSAC
# - Homography (projection between 2 planes) estimation to identify the transform between corresponding points to align the template onto the target.
# - Find Hoographic Matrix H

# Grayscale yields computational efficiency, reducing computational complexity by 1/3; Matrix moves from 3-channel features -> 1 channel.

Precision (P) = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
- Measures how many detections are correct out of all detections made.

Recall (R) = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
- Measures how many objects we found out of all objects actually present.

NOTES:
- Sainsbury's Logo Missing 'Available at' Text - Handling Partial Assets
- Effect of Low-Resolution and Handling Low-Resolution (check)
- Overlapping Bounding Boxes, Wave (Lock-up)
- Handling distorted assets - will templates match?
- Identifying more than one match of the same asset
- Checking outlines e.g Nectar Price Lozange having black outline
- Can Identify 'things' i.e. Text NOT being present - counter-factual
- Match with colour information for greater control

IMROVEMENTS
- Semantic Search over Image Space
- Leverage YOLO
